# Plan: Enable Dynamic Subagent Dispatch in Subagent-Driven Development

## Goal
Modify the `subagent-driven-development` skill's `implementer-prompt.md` to allow dynamic selection of subagent types (e.g., `frontend-developer`, `backend-architect`) instead of defaulting to `general`.

## Phase 1: Exploration & Analysis (Complete)
- [x] Locate `subagent-driven-development` skill files.
- [x] Analyze `implementer-prompt.md`.

## Phase 2: Design (Complete)
- [x] Draft the new prompt structure for `implementer-prompt.md`.

## Phase 3: Implementation (Complete)
- [x] Edit `implementer-prompt.md`.
  - Confirmed via Read tool that the file now contains the "AGENT SELECTION GUIDE" and dynamic `subagent_type`.

## Phase 4: Verification (Complete)
- [x] Verified file content structure.
- [x] Validated logic: The orchestrator will now see the selection guide and the placeholder, enabling it to choose `frontend-developer`, `backend-specialist`, etc., based on the task description.

## Phase 5: Conclusion
- [ ] Call `plan_exit`.
