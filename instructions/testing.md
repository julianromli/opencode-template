# Testing

Always check existing tests before creating one.
Never delete an existing test to make them pass. If you find a unnecessary test, ask the user first before deleting it.
If you are trying to fix a specific test, run the specific test file to verify, instead of running the whole test suite (saves time). After the specific test passes, run the whole suite to verify nothing else is broken.
When asked to test something, it's not expected that you change any code files to make the tests pass. If you think you found a bug that prevents the tests form passing, report it instead of fixing it.
