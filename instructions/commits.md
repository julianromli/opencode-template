# Git Commit Workflow

Important! On Build mode, never ever commit anything, unless I explicitly ask for it.

- Don't add description of your changes to the commit
- The commit message should say why this change was done, if not obvious.
- Commits should be small, but not 1 file per commit. Group them by scope and logically. The changes should make sense together.
- Check first the repository history to know which commit style does it use and follow it.
- Remember to follow conventional commits/add the ticket ID if this repository uses that.
- The ticket ID can be found in the current git branch name.
